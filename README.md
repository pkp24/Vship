# Vapoursynth-HIP (vship)

A high-performance VapourSynth plugin for GPU-accelerated visual fidelity
metrics, focusing on SSIMULACRA2 & Butteraugli.

**New : CLI Tool without vapoursynth named FFVship**

## Overview

`vship` provides hardware-accelerated implementations of:

- **SSIMULACRA2**: A perceptual image quality metric from Cloudinary's
  SSIMULACRA2
- **Butteraugli**: Google's psychovisual image difference metric from libjxl

The plugin uses HIP/CUDA for GPU acceleration, providing significant performance
improvements over CPU implementations.

## Projects Featuring Vship

If you want to use Vship with a pre-defined workflow, here are some projects
featuring Vship:
- [Av1an](https://github.com/rust-av/Av1an): A Cross-platform command-line AV1 / VP9 / HEVC / H264 encoding framework with per scene quality encoding 
- [SSIMULACRApy](https://codeberg.org/Kosaka/ssimulacrapy): A Python script to
  compare videos and output their SSIMU2 scores using various metrics (by
  [Kosaka](https://codeberg.org/Kosaka))
- [`metrics`](https://github.com/psy-ex/metrics): A perceptual video metrics
  toolkit for video encoder developers (by the
  [Psychovisual Experts Group](https://github.com/psy-ex/metrics))

  measuring temporal offset between two videos
- [`chunknorris`](https://github.com/Boulder08/chunknorris): A python script
  to adjust the quality encoding parameters at each scene of a video base on objective metrics
- [Media-Metrologist](https://github.com/Av1ation-Association/Media-Metrologist): Media-Metrologist is a library for measuring video quality using a suite of metrics on a per-scene and per-frame basis.
- [`lvsfunc`](https://github.com/Jaded-Encoding-Thaumaturgy/lvsfunc): JET project containing various functions to help with video processing.

## Installation

The steps to build `vship` from source are provided below.

### Dependencies
For all build options the following are requried:

- `make`
- `hipcc` (AMD) or `nvcc` (NVIDIA)

Building the plugin to use with Vapoursynth:

- VapourSynth

Building the FFvship cli tool:

- ffms2
- zimg
- pkg-config

### Build Instructions

1. Use the appropriate target for your gpu or use case.

```bash
#Vship Vapoursynth Plugin Build
make buildcuda     # Build for the current systems Nvidia gpu
make buildcudaall  # Build for all supported Nvidia gpus
make build         # Build for the current systems AMD gpu
make buildall      # Build for all supported AMD gpus

#FFVship CLI linux tool build
make buildFFVSHIPcuda      # Build for the current systems Nvidia gpu
make buildFFVSHIPcudaall   # Build for all supported Nvidia gpus
make buildFFVSHIP          # Build for the current systems AMD gpu
make buildFFVSHIPall       # Build for all supported AMD gpus
```

2. Install the Vapoursynth plugin and/or the FFVship executable.
The `install` target automatically detects and installs only the components that were built.
```bash
make install
#for arch, you need to use another prefix:
make install PREFIX=/usr
```

## Library Usage

### FFVship

```
usage: ./FFVship [-h] [--source SOURCE] [--encoded ENCODED]
                    [-m {SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli}]
                    [--start start] [--end end] [-e --every every]
                    [-t THREADS] [-g gpuThreads] [--gpu-id gpu_id]
                    [--json OUTPUT]
                    [--list-gpu]
                    Specific to Butteraugli: 
                    [--intensity-target Intensity(nits)]
```

### Vapoursynth

### Streams

In order to control the performance-to-VRAM trade-off, you may set
`numStream argument`. 4 is typically a good compromise between both.

```python
import vapoursynth as vs
core = vs.core

# Adjust based on your GPU's VRAM
result = core.vship.SSIMULACRA2(sourcefile, distortedfile, numStream = 4)
```

VRAM requirements per active Stream:

- **SSIMULACRA2**: `12 * 4 * width * height` bytes
- **Butteraugli**: `31 * 4 * width * height` bytes

### SSIMULACRA2

```python
import vapoursynth as vs
core = vs.core

# Load reference and distorted clips
ref = core.bs.VideoSource("reference.mp4")
dist = core.bs.VideoSource("distorted.mp4")

# Calculate SSIMULACRA2 scores
#numStream is the newer way of controling the performance-to-VRAM trade-off
result = ref.vship.SSIMULACRA2(dist, numStream = 4)

# Extract scores from frame properties
scores = [frame.props["_SSIMULACRA2"] for frame in result.frames()]

# Print average score
print(f"Average SSIMULACRA2 score: {sum(scores) / len(scores)}")
```

### Butteraugli

```python
import vapoursynth as vs
core = vs.core

# Load reference and distorted clips
ref = core.bs.VideoSource("reference.mp4")
dist = core.bs.VideoSource("distorted.mp4")

# Calculate Butteraugli scores
# intensity_multiplier controls sensitivity
result = ref.vship.BUTTERAUGLI(dist, distmap=0, numStream = 4)

# Extract scores from frame properties (three different norms available)
scores_2norm = [frame.props["_BUTTERAUGLI_2Norm"] for frame in result.frames()]
scores_3norm = [frame.props["_BUTTERAUGLI_3Norm"] for frame in result.frames()]
scores_infnorm = [frame.props["_BUTTERAUGLI_INFNorm"] for frame in result.frames()]

# Get all scores in one pass
all_scores = [[frame.props["_BUTTERAUGLI_2Norm"],
               frame.props["_BUTTERAUGLI_3Norm"],
               frame.props["_BUTTERAUGLI_INFNorm"]]
              for frame in result.frames()]

# Print average scores
print(f"Average Butteraugli 3Norm distance: {sum(scores_3norm) / len(scores_3norm)})
print(f"Average Butteraugli 2Norm distance: {sum(scores_2norm) / len(scores_2norm)})
print(f"Average Butteraugli MaxNorm distance: {sum(scores_infnorm) / len(scores_infnorm)})
```

You are also able to generate visual distortion maps with Butteraugli:

```python
# Set distmap=1 to visualize distortion
distmap_result = ref.vship.BUTTERAUGLI(dist, distmap=1)

# The resulting clip is a grayscale visualization of distortions
distmap_result.set_output()
```

## Performance

![Performance Comparison](Images/vshipjxl.webp)

`vship` dramatically outperforms CPU-based implementations of these metrics
while preserving a high degree of accuracy.
